Code for Final Project in Front End Foundations course

For the midterm for this course, we were given the .jpg file below, and were asked to create a web page to display the design.  I chose the design for Part I of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land.  The image for is displayed at the end of this file.

For the Final, I extended the work done for the midterm.  
1) I improved the formatting of the page so that it is truly responsive for differing viewport sizes.
2) I added footnotes that, when clicked, 
      - display a pop-up notecard with T.S. Eliot's commentary or Context commentary.  The text on some notecards can be fairly long.
      - underline the relevant text in the poem.
3) Used a google font for the notecards.
4) Notecards will scroll vertically if text overflows the notecard space.
5) Notecards will move around the screen if you mousedown and mousemove on them.
