April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
Winter kept us warm, covering
Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
A little life with dried tubers.
Summer surprised us, coming over the <span class="footnote">Starnbergersee<span class="footnum">4</span></span>
With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
And went on in sunlight, into the <span class="footnote">Hofgarten<span class="footnum">5</span></span>,
And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
<span class="footnote">Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch<span class="footnum">6</span></span>.
<span class="footnote">And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
In the mountains, there you feel free.
I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter<span class="footnum">7</span></span>.

What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of this stony rubbish? <span class="footnote">Son of man<span class="footnum">8</span></span>,
<span class="footnote">You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief<span class="footnum">9</span>,
And the dry stone no sound of water.</span> Only
There is shadow under this red rock,
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock),
And I will show you something different from either
Your shadow at morning striding behind you
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.

Frisch weht der Wind
Der Heimat zu.
Mein Irisch Kind,

'You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;
'They called me the hyacinth girl.'
—Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.
<span class="footnote"><em>Od' und leer das Meer</em><span class="footnum">11</span></span>.

<span class="footnote">Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante<span class="footnum">12</span></span>,
Had a bad cold, nevertheless
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,
<span class="footnote">With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she<span class="footnum">13</span>,
Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,
<span class="footnote">(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)<span class="footnum">14</span></span>
Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,
The lady of situations.
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,
And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,
Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find
The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.</span>
I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.
Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,
Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:
One must be so careful these days.

<span class="footnote">Unreal City<span class="footnum">15</span>,
Under the brown fog of a winter dawn</span>,
<span class="footnote">A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
I had not thought death had undone so many<span class="footnum">16</span></span>.
<span class="footnote">Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet<span class="footnum">17</span></span>.
<span class="footnote">Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours
With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine<span class="footnum">18</span></span>.
There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying 'Stetson!
'You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!
'That corpse you planted last year in your garden,
'Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?
'Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?
<span class="footnote">'Oh keep the Dog far hence, that's friend to men,
'Or with his nails he'll dig it up again<span class="footnum">19</span></span>!
<span class="footnote">'You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!'<span class="footnum">20</span></span>
